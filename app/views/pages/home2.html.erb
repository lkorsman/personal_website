    I hail from the land of 10,000 lakes and food on a stick.
    <br><br>
    Computers have always been a part of my life. My elementary school was
    one of the few to have an actual computer lab. I still remember playing
    games like Oregon Trail and Odell Lake in school. From there, the age of 
    the internet continued to fuel my interest. Throughout middle school and 
    high school I would create websites for my friends using Geocities.
    <br><br>
    I decided to explore other interests while in college. Which led me to 
    study economics and statistics. After college, I hopped around some
    of the major Minnesotan companies until I decided I needed a change and
    moved to New York City. I landed a job working for a medical software 
    company called Medidata Solutions. I spent 4.5 years working in Sales 
    Operations pricing their products. Seeing how their software made a 
    meaningful impact on society rekindled my interest in computers and 
    furthered it into software development.
    <br><br>
    I am a graduate student at Seattle University pursuing a 
    Graduate Certificate in Computer Science. My hopes are to continue into 
    Seattle University's master's program in Computer Science.
    <br><br>
    My other interests include playing and watching hockey, listening to music
    and playing the guitar, minimalism, sustainability, and learning about the
    universe.
